Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) Software Implementation
----------------------------------------------------------

This is the [Zurich University of Applied Sciences][1] software
implementation of a [PRP][2] end-node.

There is a platform independent part and a Linux userspace
(using the Linux TUN/TAP device) as well as a Linux kernelspace
adaption. PRP is implemented according to the 2012 version of
IEC 62439-3, also known as PRP-1.

It is distributed under a BSD license.

If you use this software, it could be beneficial to have contact
with our institute. Send us a short note to info.ines(at)zhaw.ch
and you will be notified about PRP-related news and events (e.g.
to get invited when a plugfest is organized).
